# AirBnB Clone Project

---

## Project Overview

This project is an ambitious endeavor to build a simplified, yet functional, clone of the popular AirBnB platform. The goal is to emulate core functionalities such as listing properties, searching for accommodations, and potentially managing bookings (the exact scope of features will be refined in later stages). This project serves as a crucial learning opportunity to apply software architectural concepts and deepen my understanding of **Full-Stack Web Development** by building both the frontend and backend components.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives for this project include:

* **Understanding and Building a Large Web Application Architecture:** Learning how to structure a complex project involving databases, APIs, and user interfaces.
* **Mastering Selected Technologies:** Gaining hands-on experience and proficiency with the chosen tech stack (listed below).
* **Applying Clean Design Principles and Maintainable Code:** Focusing on writing well-organized, readable, and easily maintainable code.
* **Building an Intuitive and Interactive User Interface:** Designing a seamless user experience that closely mimics the AirBnB experience.
* **Data Handling and Database Interaction:** Learning how to efficiently store, retrieve, and update data.

## Tech Stack

This project will be built using the following technology stack:

### Frontend

* **HTML5 / CSS3:** For structuring and styling the user interfaces.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For interactive logic and dynamic UI elements.
* **[React.js / Vue.js / Angular (Choose One):]** (Please insert your frontend framework choice here, e.g., `React.js`).
* **[Styling Framework/Library (Optional, e.g., Tailwind CSS / Styled Components):]** (Insert your styling choice here if applicable, e.g., `Tailwind CSS`).

### Backend

* **[Python / Node.js / Ruby (Choose One):]** The primary programming language for the backend (Please insert your language choice here, e.g., `Python`).
* **[Django / Flask (if Python) or Express.js (if Node.js) or Ruby on Rails (if Ruby):]** The web framework (Please insert your framework choice here, e.g., `Django`).
* **[RESTful API Design:]** For designing and developing the APIs that connect the frontend and backend.

### Database

* **[PostgreSQL / MongoDB / MySQL (Choose One):]** The database management system (Please insert your database choice here, e.g., `PostgreSQL`).

### Tools & Environment

* **Git:** Version control system.
* **GitHub:** For repository hosting and collaboration.
* **Docker (Optional):** For containerizing the application and its environment.
